This project is a simple yet elegant homepage for a dentist’s office, designed to showcase essential information with a clean and welcoming interface.

Here’s what I incorporated to create a professional and user-friendly design:
▶ Responsive Layout: The site adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
▶ Modern Design Elements: A clean and professional layout with calming colors and imagery tailored to convey trust and care.
▶ Interactive Features: Includes a smooth navigation bar and a call-to-action button to schedule appointments effortlessly.
▶ Accessibility-Friendly: Ensures the site is inclusive with proper color contrast, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigability.

Some key skills I honed during this project:
▶ Crafting responsive layouts with HTML and CSS Grid/Flexbox.
▶ Styling with CSS to create visually appealing and professional designs.
▶ Adding interactivity with JavaScript for dynamic elements like the call-to-action button.
▶ Implementing best practices for web accessibility and performance optimization.

This homepage combines simplicity with functionality, offering a polished digital presence for a dentist’s office.
